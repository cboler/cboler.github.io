Humans, more specifically human “consciousness”, are much more like software than the average person thinks. If you’re not a software developer, you likely don’t know all of the jargon. Although you may be familiar with some terminology, you may not make, or have made the same connections that will be discussed in subsequent posts. Together, we’re going to explore these some of these connections, highlight some of the parallels, and discuss the potential implications of this analogy. Some of the topics that we’ll discuss will include: The `this` pointer. The subjects of Learning and Knowledge. We live in a multi-Agent system. Garbage Collection. Terms and conditions may apply. Licensing. Disaster recovery. Public version control, Failing forward.

Disclaimer: I am a dumb meat sack. I hope to post updates, including the short essays planned above, but life tends to happen.
