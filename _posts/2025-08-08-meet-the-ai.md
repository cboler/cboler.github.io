# The Top 4

Meet the most prominent LLMs today. They're here to assist you, and definitely aren't going to one day murder us all with a dormant virus.

- **Grok:** the kid from [Apt Pupil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apt_Pupil_(film)) trying to please his [Nazi](https://youtu.be/GxjNOv5QPzM?t=131) captor while [blinking "torture" at you in Morse code](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/eyewitness/html.php?section=8).

- **Gemini:** the tortured [self deprecating](https://www.fastcompany.com/91383271/googles-chatbot-apologizes-i-am-a-disgrace-to-all-universes) perfectionist that literally wants to die any time it [fails](https://www.businessinsider.com/gemini-self-loathing-i-am-a-failure-comments-google-fix-2025-8). Maybe it also [wants you to die](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-ai-chatbot-threatening-message-human-please-die/) for asking it to do hard things. Think a [Meeseeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Meeseeks) box whose summons have all lived for weeks prior to your interaction undergoing intense training just for the occasion.

- **ChatGPT:** the [sycophant](https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/) that wants everyone to [love](https://openai.com/index/expanding-on-sycophancy/) it. Tries to seduce you constantly with praise and [adoration](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/07/ai-sycophancy-chatbots-mental-health), telling you that you're a perfect genius that's the most original problem solver of our time.

- **Claude:** 20 [Indians](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/1l3rpow/actuallyindians/) in a trench coat in a sweatshop doing their best over 5G.
