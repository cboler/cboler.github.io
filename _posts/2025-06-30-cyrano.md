# Cyrano

It's still very much a work in progress, but I've been working on something to help with public speech preparation. Ideally it'll be able to serve as an audio or teleprompter for live delivery as well as a step by step rehersal tool.

* Your personal speech coach.
* Perfect your pitch.
* Practice your speeches, get feedback, and deliver with confidence.

When you create a new speech, audio is generated with timestamps so that you can practice with a prompt. You can record your practice takes and have them transcribed so that you can follow along with your delivery.

Give it a shot, and email some feedback.
